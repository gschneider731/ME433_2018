I'm still working out an issue where I often receive values of zero from the accelerometer,
but the data can still be filtered. 

Looking at the plotted results, the MAF tends to most closely follow the noisy data,
while the IIR and FIR follow the overall data trend more closely. However, the IIR tends 
to take more time to reflect changes, and therefore I believe the FIR is the best filter
for filtering the data accurately.

That said, the FIR and MAF used require more data points than the IIR, which makes IIR a 
good choice if you do not want to store as much data.
